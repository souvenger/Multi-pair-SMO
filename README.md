# MiniProject

This repo contains the implementation of multiple pairs SMO (MP-SMO), a new solution for the SMO algorithm that consists of optimizing more than one pair of coefficients per iteration. 
We show that this algorithm improves the performance results obtained by other known SMO solutions.

We implemented for 2 pairs or 2P-SMO.
